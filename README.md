# pcapAnalysis
This repository contains scripts to start Wireshark at Windows via a WSL2 Subsystem and capturing and storing traffic for later analysis (e.g. of certificate pinning). This is partly developed for a project for a Cryptography course (INSE6110 @Concordia). 

Captured .pcap Files can be analysed e.g. as described in https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3517745.3561439
